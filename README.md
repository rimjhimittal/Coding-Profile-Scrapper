In this web application, Celery and Redis work together to handle data scraping and processing tasks efficiently. When a user requests data from LeetCode or CodeChef, the application doesn't scrape the data in real-time. Instead, these tasks are offloaded to Celery, which processes them in the background, possibly at regular intervals or triggered by specific events.
Redis, acting as a broker, manages the task queues for Celery and might also cache the scraped data. When a user makes a request, the application can quickly retrieve the latest scraped data from the Redis cache instead of waiting for a live scrape, enhancing the user experience by providing faster response times.
